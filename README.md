# Music Recommender System

This project is a Music Recommender System that uses a Decision Tree Classifier to predict the genre of music a user might like based on their age and gender.

## Project Structure

- `buidModel.ipynb`: Notebook to build and train the model.
- `getAccuracy.ipynb`: Notebook to evaluate the accuracy of the model.
- `loadModel.ipynb`: Notebook to load the trained model and make predictions.
- `visualizeModel.ipynb`: Notebook to visualize the decision tree model.
- `music.csv`: Dataset containing user information and their preferred music genre.
- `music-recommender.joblib`: Serialized trained model.
- `music-recommender.dot`: Visualization of the decision tree.
- `transactions.xlsx`: Placeholder for additional data (currently empty).
